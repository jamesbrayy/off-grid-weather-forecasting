# off-grid-weather-forecasting
a somewhat portable and completely off-grid system allowing for weather forecasting from geostationary and polar weather satellite image transmissions received via radio.

makes use of an RTL-SDR Blog v4, 3D printed helicone antenna, custom azimuth-elevation dish rotator, and Raspberry Pi 4B running custom software.

it will be submitted as my final ATAR engineering studies project.
